<h2>Book's Description</h2>
<p>This is also one of my favourite books because I 'm a huge fan of the series called Gravity Falls.&copy;</p>
<p>To get to have in front of your eyes the Journal itself it's such an epic experience, and as you read each page you unravel one more time each deep and dark secret of that region in Oregon, U. S.</p>
